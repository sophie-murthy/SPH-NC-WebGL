# SPH-JS

We have shown the SPH motion, and implemented it using Javascript.


The particles are dropped from the top and they fall under the force of gravity. Once they fall, they arrange themselves at the bottom of the canvas. 

In our project we have 3 main features:

1. There are three sliders to make changes in the orientation of the particles and the speed at which they fall. The three sliders are: gravity, Gas Constant, and Visc Constant. You can change them to see changes in the motion.

2. There is another feature where you can add additional particles by double clicking any where on the canvas. 

3. Additionally we have another feature where by holding the cursor close to the particles, the particles move away from it.



This project is made by Helios Hu (xh2376), Sophie Murthy (sam9473), and Shreya Jakhar Choudhary (sc8941).
